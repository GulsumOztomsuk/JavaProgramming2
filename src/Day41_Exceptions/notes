Exceptions Topic:
		1. Unchecked vs Checked
		2. try & catch blocks
		3. Multi-catch block
		4. finally block


OutOfMemoryError: heap memory is full

my not:
exceptions catch blockda best solution parent exception ı kullanmak olur
yani run time exception ama catch block da throwable never use because
throwable only exception parent ı degil error parent ı da aynı zamanda


Exceptions: unexpected and unwanted events
          unchecked(unexpected):occurs during the run time
          all the RunTimeExpections are unchecked exceptions

          checked(unwanted):occurs during the compile time
          all the exceptions that are not RunTimeExceptions are checked
          exception

   Exception handlings:
          1.Try & Catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked
          exceptions
          try{
          exception code
          }catch(Exception Class e){
          e.printStackTrace();
          }
